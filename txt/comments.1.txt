Samir's comments on first assignment to be fixed:

- In MovingTowardsFixedPointBuilder you do not handle the case in which only one of the values is give, it should be something like:

    Double g=9.81;
    Vector2D c = new Vector2D();
    if ( data.has("g)) g=date.getDouble("g");
    if ( data.has("c") c=....;
    Return new MovingTowardsFixedPoint(c,g);

    > DONE

- in the builders, do not use isEmpty, as if it has the key you expect 
0 in startBatchMode, if _outFile is not null you should use System.out
    > DONE


EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY:
